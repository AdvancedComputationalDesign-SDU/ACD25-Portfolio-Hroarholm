# <Hroar Holm Bertelsen> — ACD-E25 Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio documents four computational design studies developed for Advanced Computational Design during the first semester of the Master’s programme at the University of Southern Denmark. Across the series, I investigate how algorithmic rules, geometric signals, and agent-based systems can be used to generate, analyze, and rationalize architectural form. The work combines Python, NumPy, Rhino, Grasshopper, and GhPython, with an emphasis on parametric control, reproducibility, and iterative design exploration.

## Assignments

### A1: NumPy Array Manipulation for 2D Pattern Generation
In A1, I develop a pixel-based pattern generator using NumPy array operations to transform a blank canvas into structured grayscale and RGB images. The assignment focuses on array manipulation, mathematical pattern generation, normalization, and controlled randomness as a basis for visual composition.

### A2: Exploring Fractals through Recursive Geometric Patterns
In A2, I implement a recursive geometric system to explore branching and fractal-like growth. The project investigates how recursion depth, branching angles, scaling factors, and spatial constraints influence density, hierarchy, and overall legibility. Obstacle avoidance and attractor-based steering are introduced to modulate growth behavior.

### A3: Parametric Structural Canopy
In A3, I design a parametric canopy system driven by a heightmap-based scalar field and implemented in Grasshopper using GhPython. The work explores surface generation, panelization strategies, curvature-informed openings, and a recursive structural support system that responds to local geometric conditions.

### A4: Agent-Based Modeling for Surface Panelization
In A4, I develop an agent-based system for surface rationalization using Object-Oriented Programming in Python within Grasshopper. Agents operate in normalized UV space, sample geometric signals such as slope and boundary distance, and evolve over time. Their trajectories and interactions form the basis for a rationalized surface panelization strategy.

## Highlights
- **Technique:** Parametric surface generation and curvature-driven logic implemented in Grasshopper/GhPython.
- **Best result:** Parametric structural canopy with curvature-controlled panel openings and recursive supports (A3).
- **Next step:** Extending agent-based logic to directly generate panel connectivity and structural tessellation.
